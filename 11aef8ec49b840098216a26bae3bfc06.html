<h1>Background and Motivation</h1>

<section id="aws-translate" class="cell markdown" id="l64AMsFg65la">
<h3><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/translate/">AWS Translate</a></h3>
<p>Today, the world is more connected than it has ever been. And given the rate of advancement of technology, this graph will always have an upward slope. So, communication and understanding each other is of utmost importance, even if you don’t speak the same languages as someone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edenai.co/post/which-machine-translation-api-to-choose-for-your-project">Machine Translation (MT)</a> or automated translation is a process when a computer software translates text from one language to another without human involvement. Translation was one of the first applications of computing power, starting in the 1950s. Unfortunately, the complexity of the task requires enormous data processing power and storage far beyond the capabilities of early machines. Not until in the early 2000s, the computational power was strong enough to develop the statistical databases of languages to train the computers to translate text. In 2012, Google finally announced that Google Translate translates roughly enough text to fill 1 million books in one day, other major providers including Microsoft and Amazon soon followed.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Amazon Translate and Google Translate are the two leading translation services in the world, and used by most people for all kinds of translations. This includes simple tasks like ordering food in a restaurant while traveling, but also larger and more complicated tasks, like Legal research, online customer services for globalized bands, and analyzing customer opinions written in various languages.</p>
<p>The type of <a href="https://phrase.com/blog/posts/machine-translation/#which-machine-translation-type-should-i-use">Neural Machine Translation(NMT)</a> is rapidly becoming the standard in MT engine development since it uses artificial intelligence to learn languages and constantly improve that knowledge. Both the Amazon and Google translate service currently use Neural Machine Translation(NMT) as their preferred methodology since it allows for both more nuanced translation and constantly adding language pairs. As a group of students that speak several different languages, and are also learning new languages in college, we have found ourselves in constant need of these translation services such as amazon and google translate.</p>
<p>Even though the Neural MT model from Google and Amazon Translate is universally accepted as more accurate, easier to add languages, and much faster once trained, in our experience, we still often encounter the frustration of the low-quality and inaccurate translation in trying to find the right phrases or words. In taking foreign language courses, Google translate is often considered the go-to problem solver due to its accessibility and popularity, despite its lack of accuracy in terms of capturing the nuance or grammatical concepts. This was even more prominent in translating informal register compared to formal register. As a group of multi-cultured background, we often use help of translation services to text relatives, which translates more informal register. As there are higher levels of context incorporated in informal language, we have encountered problems of not being able to convey the full meaning or nuance.</p>
<p>In fact, a skill that the translation APIs lack is taking into consideration the context of the statement. Generally, the API translates individual words and tries to string them together to form a coherent sentence. However, people that are bilingual will tell you that the best way to translate a statement is by considering the meaning, intent and sentiment of the entire statement and try to convey that in the new language, instead of getting stuck on individual words.</p>
</section>
<section id="hypothesis" class="cell markdown" id="hkM7fYRG6wlX">
<h1>Hypothesis</h1>
<p>To further understand and analyze not just the individual pitfalls, but also the relative accuracies of Amazon and Google Translate, we are going to be studying the two services through a data science perspective. Based on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-translation/">AWS documentation</a>, the performance of a machine translator depends on several factors, including the Machine translation engine or technology, Language pair, Available training data and the Text types for translation such as formal and informal language styles. There are not many thorough analyses done with credible metrics to compare Amazon and Google translation API, but according to a previous survey, the translation accuracy is comparable, while AWS wins on pricing. Yet, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-translate-ranked-as-1-machine-translation-provider-by-intento/">Intento</a> recently ranked Amazon Translate as the top machine translation provider in 2020 across 14 language pairs, 16 industry sectors and 8 content types. Based on our experience of making mistakes on foreign language classes using Google translate, as well as some other research done comparing the two services, we hypothesize that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon Translate will perform better than Google Translate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We acknowledge that the measurement of translation accuracy can partly depend on styles of writing, one of which being formality of language. Therefore, add a layer and break down the hypothesis above into two parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparison of Google translate and Amazon translate for formal language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Compoarison of Google translate and Amazon translate for informal language.</p>

<h1>Data</h1>
</section>
<div class="cell markdown" id="HI_ZWzX7y3bf">
<p>To assess the quality of the translation of text, we compare Amazon Translate and Google Translate to an offical translation conducted by an expert translator. Our team has limited proficiencies in languages outside of English, so we decided to defer to experts in establishing the “gold standard” translation.</p>
</div>
<div class="cell markdown" id="GdeRBL5hy7Y7">
<p>The data that we use in this study are excerpts from the classic American novel The Great Gatsby. The Great Gatsby is regarded as one of the most highly esteemed novels of all time and has been translated into over 40 languages. Many of these translations are publicly available which contributes to a much more seamless data collection process. We are interested in examining how the specific language relates to the quality of Amazon Translate, so the sheer multitude of translations is helpful to our research. Moreover, given the novel’s stature in American literature, official translations have been conducted by skilled translators and subject to much scrutiny, increasing our confidence in the quality of the final translation. We have selected the Spanish, French, and Chinese Translations. We were curious about the difference in the quality for a variety of languages. We selected the latin-rooted languages of Spanish and French, and a very different language, Chinese.</p>

<div class="cell markdown" id="rgFuba1fy-zt">
<p>Additionally, we were interested in comparing the translation of formal and informal writing. Our team has needed translation services for more informal situations such as texting a relatives to more formal situations such as translating an academic paper. Therefore, we aim to see if Amazon translate is better suited for certain styles of writing. Fortunately, The Great Gatsby uses a wide variety of prose, so we have selected excerpts from the novel that we have deemed more formal versus informal.</p>
</div>
<section id="formal" class="cell markdown" id="3ukg9XzczAxI">
<h3><strong>formal</strong></h3>
<p>We took two random samples of text from The Great Gatsby and qualitatively deemed them more formal for the formal analyis:</p>
<p>“Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.”</p>
<p>“In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores”</p>
</section>
<section id="informal" class="cell markdown" id="jXfc_XZpzFaY">
<h3><strong>informal</strong></h3>
<p>We decided to chose the following except for the informal analyis. Since the novel was written in 1925, we have decided not to focus on slang since very informal language has changed signficantly since then, but rather language that we could see ourselves saying to a friend or family member.</p>
<p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</p>

<div class="cell markdown" id="bByhKVOLjK30">
<p>The chosen pieces of text were made into a csv file to be uploaded into S3 buckets, which were fed into the notebooks for analysis.</p>

<div class="cell markdown" id="2vE1S_m95dM-">
<p>To compare the accuracy of Google translate and Amazon translate for formal vs informal language, and for latin root vs non-latin root language, the following metrics are chosen for the reasons listed below.</p>
</div>
<section id="qualitative-comparison" class="cell markdown" id="QO5RbkwQzPAd">
<h2>Qualitative comparison</h2>
<p><strong>Metric 1</strong>: Ratings of translated text from sample users</p>
<p>Our group members will be the sample users that rate the texts that were translated into English from Chinese, Spanish, and French. In rating, we will compare the translated text to the official text and make a rating between 0 and 10.</p>
</section>
<section id="quantitative-comparison" class="cell markdown" id="LE_694LbzUG6">
<h2>Quantitative comparison</h2>
<p><strong>Metric 1</strong>: Percentage of words that are accurate when comparing the translated text to the “gold standard official” translation</p>
<p>In terms of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/bleu-bilingual-evaluation-understudy-2b4eab9bcfd1">Machine Translation</a>,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$Precision = \frac{number\,of \,candidate\, translation\, words\, occuring\, in\, any\, reference\, translation}{total\, number\,of\, words\, in\,candidate\, translation}$</span></p>
<p>Where candidate translation refers to the machine translation of interest, and reference translation refers to human reference translation that is established to fully convey the meaning of a text. In short, the more the number of matches between machine translation and human translation, the better the machine translation is.</p>
<p>Therefore, our first metric is the percentage of words that overlap in the original text and translated text. However, this is a relatively low level metric as does not capture more complicated aspects of language such as the order of the overlapping words or the use of synonyms. Moreover, an <a href="https://devopedia.org/n-gram-model">n-gram</a> refers to a sequence of words occurring together within a window of n words, which is important in producing a more natural sentence. Therefore, we used a more well established and well known metric, BLEU score.</p>
</section>
<div class="cell markdown" id="4NcGiR_IjZIW">
<p><strong>Metric 2</strong>: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/nlp-metrics-made-simple-the-bleu-score-b06b14fbdbc1">BLEU Score</a> stands for Bilingual evaluation Understudy. It is a <a href="https://machinelearninginterview.com/topics/natural-language-processing/bleu-score/#:~:text=What%20is%20BLEU%20Score%3F,manual%20evaluator%20or%20a%20translator.">well established</a> metric used to "evaluate the quality of machine generated text by comparing it with a reference text that is supposed to be generated." Unlike metric 1, BLEU score calculation takes into account n-grams, how words are repeated, and many more.</p>
<p>We consulted a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/gist/bshmueli/ce62e435bbcb5b41f797c0b8c4d0f4b9/bleu-demo.ipynb">Bleu demo on python</a> to obtain a more nuanced analysis of the translations.</p>

<section id="analysis" class="cell markdown" id="MiyhO8676yfA">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
</section>
<div class="cell markdown" id="DjhoGp_1rmeo">
<p>Refer to Final AWS notebook, Final Google notebook, and Final Project Analysis notebook.</p>
</div>
<section id="results" class="cell markdown" id="I5g75EvL60y5">
<h1>Results</h1>
</section>
<div class="cell markdown" id="11LZqqeLjzHU">
<p>We believe that out of metrics used, the Average Qualitative Scores and Average BLEU Scores are the most important. This is because the "Percentage of Qualtitative Scores above 7" doesn't distinguish between the groups as much, and the "Average Percent Words Match" score isn't as reliable because synonyms in two different translations may convey the same meaning even though the words themselves are different.</p>
<p>Therefore, we think that the Average Qualitative Scores and Average BLEU Scores are the most important. The Qualitative Scores reflect how a person fluent in English would interpret the texts, and the BLEU score reflects a commonly-used, reliable NLP metric used to compare translations of a text.</p>
<p>Overall, with the phrases chosen from the Great Gatsby, Google performed better with the Qualitative Analysis, BLEU score, and Match score. For the informal translations, AWS performed better. For the formal translations, Google performed better.</p>
<p>For Google and AWS, we see that as the Qualitative Score increased, so did the BLEU Score. Similarly, as the Qualitative Score increased, so did the Match Score. For both AWS and Google, the regression line for the BLEU score vs Qualitative Score is steeper, indicating a potentially stronger relationship.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
</section>
<div class="cell markdown" id="e83nVc9bqEyE">
<p>From the results with excerpts from the Great Gatsby, it can be inferred that Google can be used for more formal translations and therefore may be better for students who are learning a new language since classes typically teach languages in a more formal manner. Yet, AWS may be better when learning the more “informal” version of a language.</p>
<p>However, there are a few areas of improvement to our metrics and our data collection. First and foremost, quantitative metrics 1 nor 2 cannot handle semantic similarity. They both look for exact matches, but the quality of synonym use is an important aspect to incorporate in the future.</p>
<p>Moreover, Neither Google translate nor Amazon translate was tested with "slangs" or modern internet languages. It is important to acknowledge that language continue to evolve. Therefore, a possible research in the future can be done with texts spanning between a long time frame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it would be helpful if we could generate a distribution of each metric to see if there are statistically significant differences to make conclusive statements. The size of the data we have as of now is small, but with a sizeable amount of data in the future, we could verify the significance of each metric.</p>
<p>Evaluating language translation is a tricky area since there is a high degree of subjectivity and nuance that cannot be translated into machine languages. Moreover, language continues to evolve, so investigation should be done with a more diverse and bigger dataset and be done continuosly over time.</p>
